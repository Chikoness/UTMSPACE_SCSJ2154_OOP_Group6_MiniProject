**Case Study**
**Event Invitation Management System**

Event invitation management is the application which can be used to manage event information such as type of events: eg, birthday, wedding, anniversary, celebration. It is also used to store the number of attendees, how many types of food, place of event, date of event, and printing the bill. It is a menu driven program and it runs until the user exits. (Topics covered will be written later)
